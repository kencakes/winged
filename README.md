> Winged is a web application designed for falconry enthousiasts who want to keep detailed records of their feathered friends. The platform allows users to create virtual profiles for their  birds, helping them log essential information such as weight, daily food intake and other relevant activities. The data is then presented through an intuitive dashboard, featuring insightful graphs and charts to provide a comprehensive overview of the bird's well-being and habits.
